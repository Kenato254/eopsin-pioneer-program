# Using the Cardano CLI to Interact with Plutus

As contracts written in OpShin can be interacted with in just the same way as Plutus smart contracts, we refer to the corresponding [lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MbzKzoBiak) to learn how to use the Cardano CLI.

## Using `pycardano` to Interact with the `gift` Example Contract

Another way to interact with Cardano smart contracts is via the `pycardano` python library. In the following lectures, all off-chain components will be written in python and using `pycardano`. Therefore, we use the `gift` example here to demonstrate how to recreate the same functionality as in the CLI version above with `pycardano`.
